Application Architecture Documentation
High-Level Component Diagram
The high-level component diagram visualizes the structure and flow of the Paw's Application's front-end and backend services.

Development Environment: During development, the application's front end is served by the Vite Development Server, which facilitates hot reloading and fast builds. The communication between the web client and the server uses the HTTPS protocol with JSON format for data exchange.

Production Environment: In production, the static files generated by the build process are hosted on AWS S3 and delivered through CloudFront. This setup ensures high availability and fast content delivery.

Backend Services: Firebase serves as the backend, handling critical services such as authentication, database operations, and other server-side functions. The communication between the web server and Firebase relies on the HTTPS protocol with BSON data format for efficient binary serialization.

User Account Creation Flow
The sequence diagram illustrates the process of creating a new user account within the application.

User Interaction: The user starts by entering their details on the Sign Up page.
Form Submission: Upon form submission, the user's data is passed to the Auth Context.
Create Account Request: The Auth Context sends a request to Firebase Authentication Service to register the new user.
Validation: Firebase Authentication Service validates the credentials.
Error Handling: In case of an error during account creation, such as a duplicate email, the error is returned and displayed to the user.
Success: On successful creation of the account, the UI is updated, potentially redirecting the user to their profile or dashboard.

New Account Creation Process ERD
The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) maps out the data model involved in the new account creation process.

Users Entity: Represents registered users of the application with the following attributes:

username (String): Chosen username by the user.
password (String): User's password.
email (String, PK): User's email address, serving as the primary key.
UserProfiles Entity: Connected to the Users entity, indicating that each user has an associated profile. 

UserSettings Entity: Also related to the Users entity.

The relationships shown in the ERD point to a 1-to-1 correlation between Users and both UserProfiles and UserSettings. Each user entity correlates to a single profile and a single settings record.
